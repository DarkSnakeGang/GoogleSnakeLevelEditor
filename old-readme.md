### Features:
- Place Fruit/Walls/Sokoban Boxes directly onto the board with your mouse.
- Play premade levels from the presets panel
- Make your own custom presets from the custom presets panel
- Import/Export presets from the custom presets panel (i.e. to share with others).
- Challenge Mode. Play a series of 20 increasingly difficult snake levels
- Random Ham Mode. Play random always winnable wall small patterns (Ham stands for Hamiltonian cycle).

### How to install:
1. Download the bookmark file in [releases](https://github.com/DarkSnakeGang/GoogleSnakeLevelEditor/releases/latest)
2. Import the bookmark into your browser (see https://gyazo.com/736585ad892bba86cf5fdb0996d4937f )
3. Start playing google snake
4. Click the bookmark

Note: By default you will go straight through the walls/sokoban boxes. Change the gamemode to wall mode/sokoban mode (or a mix with the blender gamemode) to stop this from happening.
